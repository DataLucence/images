## Installation

To get up and running with this course, you will need

1) Git. You'll want the command line interface. See [these downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2) A scientific Python distribution. You can get set up through pip piecemeal, but it's much easier to just grab [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Please get the Python 3.5 verison.
3) Some additional Python packages.
- `pip install moviepy`

## Development

This notebook contains specialized scripts and configurations for making git play nicely with Jupyter notebooks. After cloning this repository, please run `./configure-git` to set up a git filter which will keep notebook output from being version controlled.
