## Process Used

This lesson is being developed using a slimmed-down variant of the "Understanding by Design" process.
The main sections are:

1.  Assumptions about audience, time, etc.
    (The current draft also includes some conclusions and decisions in this 
    section - that should be refactored.)

2.  Desired results:
    overall goals, summative assessments at half-day granularity, what learners 
    will be able to do, what learners will know.

3.  Learning plan:
    each episode has a heading that summarizes what will be covered,
    then estimates time that will be spent on teaching and on exercises,
    while the exercises are given as bullet points.

## Stage 1: Assumptions

*   Audience
    *   Graduate students in neuroscience.
    *   FIXME: more about their background and prior knowledge.
*   Constraints
    *   FIXME: three full days.
        *   Full course is ten half days.
        *   First four half days are a standard Software Carpentry workshop.
    *   Learners use native installs on their own machines
        *   May use VMs or cloud resources at instructor's discretion
        *   But must keep native local install as an option
    *   Use the Jupyter Notebook for Python.
        *   Authentic tool used by many instructors.
        *   There isn't really an alternative...
*   Motivating Examples
    *   FIXME: brief summary of what learners will learn how to do.
*   Data
    *   FIXME: describe data sets
*   Challenges will mostly *not* be "write this code from scratch"
    *   Want lots of short exercises that can reliably be finished in allotted time
    *   So use "fix this pipeline", "fill in the blanks", Parsons Problems, etc.

## Stage 2: Desired Results

### Questions

How do I...

*   ...FIXME: questions that learners have *before* they meet us.

### Skills

I can...

*   ...FIXME: what can they do after the class?

### Concepts

I know...

*   ...FIXME: major landmarks in their mental model.

## Stage 3: Learning Plan

### Summative Assessments

*   FIXME: what can learners do at the end of each half day?

### Lesson 1: FIXME (title)

Map the first half day.

#### What (9:00)
{:.no_toc}

*   Teaching: 15 min
    *   FIXME: point-form summary of main ideas.
*   Challenges: 15 min
    *   FIXME: point-form summary of each exercise.

#### What (9:30)
{:.no_toc}

*   Teaching: 10 min
    *   FIXME: carry on as above
*   Challenges: 20 min
    *   FIXME: as above.

### Lesson 2: FIXME (title)

Map the second half day.
