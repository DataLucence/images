    "### A rat behavior experiment\n",
    "A post-doc wants to do a rat behavior experiment. For the experiment to work, it's critical to know whether or not the rat is moving at any give point in time. Each experiment runs for over an hour, but our post-doc reasons that she can set up a video camera synchronized to the rest of the experimental equipment, record the rat moving around its habitat, and determine when motion happened later, perhaps by doing some image processing. A labmate suggests she attach a bright red light to the rat's head to make it easy to track by computer - just find the reddest part in the red channel at each frame! Our post-doc does this, then collects more than 30 hours worth of data over two weeks."
